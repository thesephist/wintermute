There are three different ways to think about and measure time in life.

1. With respect to calendar years. Set goals, measure progress, perform life-sustaining activity.
2. With respect to other people in your life, and how they're before you or after you. You parents are a generation in the past; your neighbors' kids are a half generation in the future.
3. Look at all time together, and time as nonlinear; a painting, which is revelaed over time, but which is revisited nonlinearly; _Comet_ style.
