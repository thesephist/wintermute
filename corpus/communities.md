There are two ways to view history. Through Harari's social contracts view, and through communities view. Duality.

In the communities view, the force that moves history is the fact that groups of people come together and move together by finding and forming communities where their individual personal stories intersect. Not every story is equal or even relatable and this means some groups will form more easily than others.

These groups grow into communities, which have emergent dynamics. These communities are empathy distributing systems which are more powerful than value. And the interaction of these communities move history along.

This is my thesis on history and future of humanity. Study history thru this lens. Blog post. Maybe a multiparty series on community of which this is the last.

1. designing communities
2. community as a product
3. community as a force in humanity

^ roughly corresponding to v

1. Community as an empathy distribution system
2. Community as a learned place
3. Community as a reification of common beliefs

good communities, as empathy distribution systems, are antifragile -- under crisis, they come closer together

Learned places hold lore. Lore invites exploration. Exploration creates new stories. Lore is just these stories told collectively. That's the cycle. Hacker spaces are learned places. So is the New York subway. What does a digital learner place look like?

We as designers can design spaces to more easily learn.

The strongest communities leave legacies. The legacies of communities live on as learned places, whether physical and geographical, or in artifacts. This is why Meccas and holy places are so significant in history and in religion, the strongest communities.

- Community evolves by continually forking and merging ideas and beliefs -- a la memetics.
