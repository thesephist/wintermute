Today, UC Berkeley sent out acceptance results to the tends of thousands of high school seniors across the world who applied for the 2020-2021 school year, and some friends have asked for my two cents on being an undergraduate student on the campus. So I tried to outline some of my opinions about Cal here, and my thoughts so far, halfway into my career at Cal.

This isn't meant to be a comprehensive guide to Berkeley, or anything like that. Just my two cents, a single data point.

I'm a student in the College of Letters and Sciences ("L&S"), Cal's liberal arts school, which notably excludes the storied EECS department at Cal. But the experience between an L&S-bound CS student and my EECS friends seem functionally equivalent.


Yeah dm me! I'm trying to write something up more publicly but my main advice for course selection is: your first semester is to figure out who the hell you wanna be for the next 4 years -- what you awnt to be a part of, who you want to hang out with. Courses come later. So take it light. 13/14 units is fine. Take 61A and suffer through it with all your friends. Take a R1A/B if you need it. Take a DeCal because it's fun.
